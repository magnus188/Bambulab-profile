# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

This project follows a simple versioning approach:

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| Latest (main branch) | ✅ Security updates provided |
| Previous versions   | ❌ No security support |

Since this is an active open-source project, security fixes are applied to the main branch and deployed continuously.

## 🚨 Reporting Security Vulnerabilities

If you discover a security vulnerability, please report it responsibly:

### For Serious Security Issues:
1. **Do NOT** create a public GitHub issue
2. **Email the maintainer** directly at the contact information in the repository
3. **Include in your report**:
   - Clear description of the vulnerability
   - Steps to reproduce the issue
   - Potential impact assessment
   - Suggested fix (if you have one)

### For Less Critical Issues:
- You can create a GitHub issue with the "security" label
- Use the security issue template if available

## 🔒 Security Measures in Place

This project implements multiple layers of security:

### Environment & Configuration Security
- ✅ All sensitive data stored in environment variables
- ✅ `.env.local` files are git-ignored to prevent credential leaks
- ✅ Example configuration files contain no real credentials
- ✅ Production secrets managed securely through Vercel

### Firebase Security
- ✅ Firestore security rules protect user data
- ✅ Authentication required for all write operations
- ✅ User data isolation - users can only access their own profiles
- ✅ File upload validation and size limits
- ✅ Storage security rules prevent unauthorized access

### Application Security
- ✅ Input validation on all user-submitted data
- ✅ File type and size validation for uploads
- ✅ XSS protection through React's built-in escaping
- ✅ CSRF protection through Firebase's authentication tokens

### Deployment Security
- ✅ HTTPS enforced on all deployed versions
- ✅ Environment variables securely managed in deployment platform
- ✅ No secrets exposed in GitHub Actions logs or client-side code
- ✅ Secure headers configured for production

## 🛡️ Security Guidelines for Contributors

### Before Contributing:
- ✅ Review this security policy
- ✅ Understand the environment variable structure
- ✅ Set up your own Firebase project for development

### While Developing:
- ❌ **NEVER** commit API keys, passwords, or credentials
- ❌ **NEVER** commit `.env.local` files
- ✅ **ALWAYS** use environment variables for sensitive configuration
- ✅ **ALWAYS** validate user inputs in your code
- ✅ **ALWAYS** follow the principle of least privilege

### Security-Focused Code Reviews:
When reviewing PRs, check for:
- No hardcoded credentials or API keys
- Proper input validation and sanitization
- Appropriate access controls
- No sensitive data in logs or error messages

## 🔍 Security Testing

Contributors should test for:
- **Authentication flows**: Ensure users can only access their own data
- **File uploads**: Verify file type and size restrictions work
- **Input validation**: Test with various input types and edge cases
- **Error handling**: Ensure error messages don't leak sensitive information

## 📦 Dependency Security

- Dependencies are regularly reviewed for vulnerabilities
- Automated security updates are enabled where possible
- Contributors should run `npm audit` before submitting PRs
- Major dependency updates go through additional security review

## 🚀 Security Updates Process

1. **Vulnerability Assessment**: Security issues are triaged quickly
2. **Fix Development**: Security fixes are prioritized over feature development
3. **Testing**: Security fixes undergo thorough testing
4. **Deployment**: Critical security updates are deployed immediately
5. **Communication**: Security updates are documented in release notes

## 📋 Incident Response

In case of a security incident:
1. **Immediate containment** of the issue
2. **Assessment** of scope and impact
3. **Communication** with affected users (if any)
4. **Fix deployment** as soon as possible
5. **Post-incident review** to prevent recurrence

## 🤝 Community Security

This project relies on the security vigilance of its contributors and users:
- **Report concerns** when you see them
- **Follow security best practices** in your contributions
- **Keep your development environment secure**
- **Help others** understand security requirements
